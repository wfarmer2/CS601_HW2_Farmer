            <h2>Career Background</h2>
                <span title="General Motors logo"><img src="../images/gm_logo.png" alt="General Motors company logo"

                    <p>
                        After completing my undergraduate degrees from Arizona State University (ASU), I started my
                        career in June 2020 for General Motors located in Chandler, Arizona at the company's Arizona 
                        IT Innovation Center (AIC) office. I started as a <em>Software Developer</em> in the <strong>Customer
                        Care & Aftersales (CCA)</strong> organization of the company. Within CCA, the specific space that I operated under
                        is that of the <strong>Supply Chain, Warehousing, and Logisitics (SCWL)</strong>. As a <em>Software Developer</em> I have worked on applications
                        that use neural networks to forecast part demand for the company's supply chain, maintained an exisiting finance application for the 
                        CCA Finance team, and have done production support for several global forecasting applications that require on-call duties to remediate production issues.
                        Most recently, I have decided to transition into a <em>Business Analyst</em> role within the SCWL space to better understand the business side of my 
                        company's organization to build better systems. Utilizing my technical knowledge and ability to communicate to stakeholders in the company
                        is something that I am excited for in my career journey!
