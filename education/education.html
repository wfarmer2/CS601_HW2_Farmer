                        I attended Arizona State University (ASU) where I earned a B.S. in Business Data Analytics 
                        and a B.S. in Marketing in May 2020. While I was attending ASU, I was heavily involved in the
                        Department of Information Systems Club (DISC) that was focused on professional development within
                        the business and technology space, respectively. Through DISC I was able to network with classmates, 
                        university alum, company representatives, and even compete in a national data competition where my team 
                        placed 2nd in Data Graphics. To learn more about the data competition, please click this

                        My time at ASU was full of great memories and learning opportunities that will always make me proud
                        to call myself a Sun Devil!

            <h2>Graduate Education Background</h2>
                <span title="Boston University logo"><img src="../images/bu_logo.png" alt="Boston University school logo"

                    <p>
                        After starting my career directly after graduating from Arizona State University (ASU), I decided to further
                        enrich my education by enrolling in the M.S. in Software Development program at Boston University (BU). Recently,
                        I have also enrolled in the Certificate in Web Application Development alongside my degree program. The main reason
                        I chose BU for my graduate studies is for the flexible online program that the university offers and the wonderful faculty 
                        and staff that help operate the program. Through my learning I have strengthened my current skills, developed new skills,
                        and deepened my knowledge within programming and technology in general. My planned graduation date is May of 2023 and I cannot
                        wait to be able to celebrate my accomplishments in Boston, Massachusetts in the summer!
